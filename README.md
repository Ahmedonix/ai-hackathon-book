# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational book project. This comprehensive resource teaches students from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced AI-integrated humanoid robotics through 4 progressive modules.

## Overview

This book is designed to take you from ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced AI-integrated humanoid robotics. Each module builds upon the previous one with increasing complexity and integration:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2. **Module 2**: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity) [COMPLETED]
3. **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (Isaac Sim & Nav2)
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action Cognitive Robotics

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer with ROS 2 Iron installed
- For full experience: NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4070 Ti or better recommended)
