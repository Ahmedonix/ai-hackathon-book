# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics Education

This comprehensive educational resource is designed to take you from ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced AI-integrated humanoid robotics. Whether you're a robotics enthusiast, AI researcher, or developer interested in physical AI applications, this book will guide you through the essential concepts, tools, and techniques needed to build intelligent humanoid robots.

### Book Structure

The book is organized into four progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Master the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture, communication patterns, and implementation techniques.
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)** - Create, simulate, and test humanoid robots within physics-based digital environments. **[COMPLETED]**
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (Isaac Sim & Nav2)** - Build an AI brain for humanoid robots using NVIDIA's Isaac platform.
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Cognitive Robotics** - Integrate voice, vision, language, and action into a unified intelligent system.

### What You'll Learn

- ROS 2 Iron architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Physics-based simulation with Gazebo and Unity Robotics Hub
- AI perception pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac ROS
- Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Navigation and motion planning for humanoid robots
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architectures
- Integration of Whisper and GPT models with robotic systems
- Deployment strategies for edge computing platforms like NVIDIA Jetson

### Prerequisites

- Intermediate Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer capable of running ROS 2 and simulation environments
- For full experience: NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4070 Ti or better recommended)

### Getting Started

Start with [Module 1](./module1-ros2/) to establish your ROS 2 foundation, then progress sequentially through each module. Each module builds upon the previous one with increasing complexity and integration.
