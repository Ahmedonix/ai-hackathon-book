# Practical Exercises

## Overview

This section contains hands-on exercises that reinforce the concepts covered in the AI-Robot Brain module. These exercises are designed to give you practical experience implementing perception, navigation, and control systems using Isaac Sim and Nav2.

## Available Exercises

1. [Exercise 1: Isaac Sim Setup and Basic Perception](./exercise-1.md) - Setting up Isaac Sim environment and basic perception systems
2. [Exercise 2: VSLAM Implementation](./exercise-2.md) - Building visual SLAM systems for environment mapping
3. [Exercise 3: Nav2 Navigation Pipeline](./exercise-3.md) - Configuring and testing navigation systems
4. [Exercise 4: AI Pipeline Integration](./exercise-4.md) - End-to-end integration of perception, navigation, and control

Complete these exercises sequentially to build a comprehensive understanding of AI systems for humanoid robotics.
